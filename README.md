# Goal

You work for a company that has created a social network around hot deals and products that are on sale. Users aren't starting to use the site and your boss suspects that it's because of the low quality design.

The designer has just created a nice mockup for the new design of the site and you were asked to bring it to life.

This is a pure styling simulation. You will need to:
- Understand the data you are given
- Understand the current html structure and modify it to look better
- Understand the current CSS structure and modify it to look better

# Running/Environment

- Make sure you **fork** this repository to your own Github, then clone it to your computer
- Install all the dependencies from `package.json` file using `npm install`
- Then, start the server by using running `node server.js`
- Navigate to your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`



# To Do

## Main goal:

- Make the web page look like this:

<!-- <p align="center"><img src="assets/Landingpage.png"/></p> -->

## Navbar
- Start with the navbar
- It should be 'sticky', meaning when you scroll it should scroll with the page
- See the following gif to see how it should look

<!-- <p align="center"><iframe src="assets/scroll.gif"></iframe></p> -->

## Products
- Edit the handlebars template if you need
- Modify the CSS to make it look like the mockup

# Features

- Add a 'load more' button as per the gif below
    - Initially only load 12 products
    - When the 'load more' button is clicked, load the rest
